# movie-trailer

Project 1 of Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program at Udacity

Please go to http://zhangtreefish.github.io/movie-trailer/ to see a short list of my favorite films, and click on the poster to view the trailer.

Used objected-oriented Python programing to create the list of films, and use a web server to serve HTML.
